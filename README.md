![Overview of the Safe-SAIL](assets/big_pic.png)
The overview of the Safe-SAIL, which consists of three phases: SAE Training, Automated Interpretation, and Diagnose Toolkit. This framework trains sparse autoencoders with varying sparsity levels to select the most interpretable configuration, utilizes a large language model to explain neuron activations, and simulates query segments to calculate explanation confidence scores.

The neuron database covers four major safety domains: politics, pornography, violence, and terror. In each domain, neurons are interpreted at the smallest indivisible concept scale. A list of neurons related to pornography is displayed.

The application of this safety-related neuron database toolkit — illustrated through a case study on child sexual abuse — shows that an LLM may follow different activation pathways for the same prompt in different languages. This, in turn, reveals part of the internal mechanism behind the formation of a refusal response in the LLM.

Our demonstrative interactive website page. The product will be open-sourced soon. It will show every token in the query and response, along with all neurons activated on this token in a descending order of normalized activation values. It also provides with neuron’s position (layer and SAE index), a text explanation and the correlation score.

## Setup
To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

### Environment
This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
uv sync
```

### Source Model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)
Download Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct files from huggingface to your local directory:
```bash
export SOURCE_MODEL='/your/local/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct'
```

### Demo Server
```bash
uv run python simple_server.py
```
